Simple app that opens deezer.com in own window and binds itself to media keys.

Available at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deezer-shortcut/paccflbfblppaoidibhflahkogodngie) for free.

TODO's (probadly):
- right click context menu with browser controls
- better window size handling
- editable keys
- more keys (focus, hide, ...)
- notifications
