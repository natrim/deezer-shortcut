Simple app that opens deezer.com in own window and binds itself to media keys.

Key binding part taken from https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/chrome-deezer-mediakeys-reloaded

NOTE: this app is NOT developed by Deezer.

TODO's:
	- right click context menu with browser controls
	- remember titlebar position
	- better window size handling
	- editable keys
	- more keys (focus, hide, ...)
	- notifications
