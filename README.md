Simple app that opens deezer.com in own window and binds itself to media keys.

NOTE: this app is NOT developed by Deezer.
NOTE2: this app maybe works

TODO's:
- right click context menu with browser controls
- better window size handling
- editable keys
- more keys (focus, hide, ...)
- notifications

Key binding part "lent" from https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/chrome-deezer-mediakeys-reloaded
